# glean — Changelog

## 2026-07-05 — Store model Stages B + C: controlled dirs + export/import
Completes the git-core directive.
- **Stage B — controlled directories.** `glean control [<dir>]` marks a directory
  as its own capture instance (`<dir>/.glean` with a `CONTROLLED` marker).
  Store resolution now walks up from CWD: `GLEAN_WORKSPACE` override → nearest
  controlled dir → global store. Captures run inside a controlled dir (or a
  subdir) route to its instance, and each capture commit **snapshots the
  directory's contents as context** (`context/manifest.tsv`: path/size/mtime/sha1,
  excluding `.glean`/`.git`). `glean instances` lists controlled dirs (from a
  registry in the global store); `glean uncontrol` releases one (data kept).
- **Stage C — export / import.** `glean export [<file>]` bundles the whole store
  (all datasets + capture commits + tags) into a portable `git bundle`;
  `glean import <file> [<dest>]` reconstitutes it elsewhere. Verified: after a
  move, the imported store's datasets, capture log, and per-row `#N → source`
  provenance are all browsable.
- Fixed a `set -e` escape: the controlled-dir context snapshot in `_ingest` ran
  as a bare `func || true` (current shell), so an internal failure aborted before
  the guard; now wrapped in a subshell.
- Smoke test → 27 checks (adds control/subdir-routing/context/instances +
  export/import round-trip); all pass. Version 0.4 → 0.5-proto.
- Files: `glean/glean`, `glean/tests/smoke.sh`, `glean/HANDOFF.md`,
  `glean/CHANGELOG.md`.
- **Still deferred:** `stats` (vendor envoy-analyze) and schema reconciliation.

## 2026-07-04 — Store model Stage A: global store + per-row provenance
Implements the fuller "git core" directive (row→source traceability, global
store, multi-user).
- **Global store by default:** captures go to `$GLEAN_HOME` (or `~/.glean`) so you
  can capture from any directory without being in a workspace. `GLEAN_WORKSPACE`
  is an explicit override (wins; used by tests). `doctor` reports which store and
  the next row index.
- **Per-row provenance with a visible `#N` index:** every dataset row gets a
  globally-unique index as its first column (shown by `show`). New
  `glean source <#N>` maps a row back to the exact captured input that produced
  it (prints the capture meta + stored `output.txt`). Provenance recorded in
  `provenance.tsv` (`#` → dataset → capture); a monotonic counter in
  `.next_row_id`.
- **Multi-user safe:** a `mkdir`-based store lock (stale-PID break, configurable
  `GLEAN_LOCK_TIMEOUT`) serialises concurrent writers; `git init` uses
  double-checked locking so parallel first-writers to a shared store don't race.
  Verified: 8 concurrent captures into a fresh shared store → 8 distinct indices,
  0 duplicates, git fsck clean.
- `_ingest` now assigns `#N`, writes provenance, and commits under the lock; both
  `run` and pipe-`inject` go through it. Smoke test → 17 checks (adds `#N`,
  `source`, concurrency); all pass. Version 0.3 → 0.4-proto.
- Files: `glean/glean`, `glean/tests/smoke.sh`, `glean/HANDOFF.md`.
- **Still pending (proposal Stages B/C + analyze):** controlled directories,
  export/import, `stats`, schema reconciliation.

## 2026-07-04 — Phase-3: git core — capture-as-commit + restore
- The workspace is now a **git repo**: every capture is one commit tagged
  `capture-<id>`, replacing the flat-TSV-only store. Added verbs:
  - `glean run [--] <cmd>` — execute a binary, capture combined stdout+stderr,
    auto-detect + file it, and commit the capture (records `captures/<id>/meta.tsv`
    + `output.txt`).
  - `glean log` — list captures (id, timestamp, source, strategy, dataset, command).
  - `glean restore <id|latest>` — check a capture's committed tree back out
    (detached) to bring that run back up; `latest` returns to `main`.
- Refactored the extract→classify→melt→store core into a shared `_ingest` used by
  both `run` and pipe-`inject`; both now commit. `doctor` reports git-backed.
- Chosen model: simplified **linear git history** (one commit per capture) rather
  than EnvoyCapture's per-run + `__dataset`/`__results`/`__scripts` orphan-branch
  machinery (proposal 0001 §7).
- Smoke test extended to 11 checks incl. run→log→restore→restore-latest; all pass.
- Still deferred to Phase-3 cont.: `stats` (vendor envoy-analyze) and schema
  reconciliation (union columns vs `.v2` split).

## 2026-07-04 — Phase-2 fix: relayout to extract/ + lib/, vendor missing deps
- The first Phase-2 vendor (below) under-copied: the cross-suite shared libs
  (`envoy_version.sh`, `envoy_progress.sh`, …) and `EnvoyExtract/tools/` were left
  out, so 13 suite tests regressed (`--version`, `-V`, `--progress`,
  `new_strategy.sh`/`review_strategy.sh`) — all green upstream but failing
  vendored. Also, nesting the engine at `lib/extract/` put its `../lib` at the
  confusing `lib/lib`.
- Fix: moved the vendored engine to `glean/extract/` and the shared libs to
  `glean/lib/` (the engine's `../lib`), mirroring the upstream engine-dir +
  sibling-`lib/` layout so the suite resolves paths unchanged. `sync-extract.sh`
  now also vendors `tools/` and the repo-root `lib/*.sh`. All 4 previously-failing
  files pass in the new location (21/21, 8/8, 13/13, 21/21). `glean` `_find_engine`
  updated to `extract/envoy-extract`. **Full vendored suite now genuinely green:
  216/216 test files passed, 1103 assertions, 0 failed (exit 0)** — correcting an
  earlier premature "green" claim that was based on a partial run (the full run
  had in fact exited 1 with the 13 failures above).
- Files: `glean/extract/**` (relocated + `tools/`), `glean/lib/*.sh` (shared),
  `glean/tools/sync-extract.sh`, `glean/extract/README.md`, `glean/glean`,
  `glean/HANDOFF.md`.

## 2026-07-04 — Phase-2: vendor the extract engine into lib/extract/
- Vendored the full extract engine (entry point + `lib/` + all 202 strategies +
  tests + samples; ~1,145 files) from `EnvoyExtract/` into `glean/lib/extract/`
  so the tree is self-contained and runnable without the sibling project.
- Added `tools/sync-extract.sh` — refreshes the vendored copy from `EnvoyExtract/`
  (source of truth until the Phase-5 hard cut) and writes `lib/extract/VENDOR.json`
  (source git SHA, timestamp, component list, strategy/file counts) so drift is
  visible. Supports `--runtime-only`. Added `lib/extract/README.md` (do-not-edit +
  how-to-sync note).
- `glean` `_find_engine` now resolves the vendored copy first; the
  sibling-`EnvoyExtract/` walk-up is demoted to a transition fallback.
- Confirmed the strategy/engine suite passes in the new location
  (`bash glean/lib/extract/tests/run_tests.sh`) and `glean/tests/smoke.sh` still
  passes against the vendored engine.
- Files: `glean/lib/extract/**` (vendored), `glean/tools/sync-extract.sh`,
  `glean/lib/extract/README.md`, `glean/glean`, `glean/HANDOFF.md`.

## 2026-07-04 — Phase-1 prototype
- New `glean/` tree (proposal 0001): single-binary `glean` implementing the
  product's one path — `cmd | glean` auto-detects format via the real extract
  engine (`--emit-meta`, all 198 strategies), melts to one row per record, and
  files it into a per-type dataset. Verbs: default inject, `ls`, `show`,
  `triage`, `doctor`, `help`.
- Minimal flat-TSV store under `$GLEAN_WORKSPACE` (default `./.glean`); differing
  headers split to numbered variants (git store + schema reconciliation deferred
  to Phase 3). Engine resolved via sibling `EnvoyExtract/` fallback until Phase 2
  copies it under `glean/lib/extract/`.
- Files: `glean/glean`, `glean/HANDOFF.md`, `glean/CHANGELOG.md`,
  `glean/tests/smoke.sh`.
